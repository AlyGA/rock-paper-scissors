# rock-paper-scissors
DISCLAIMER: This project idea came from the Odin Project. All variable names are credited to the project. However, any other code is completely written from scratch.

This project was an exercise to practice the JavaScript concepts that I had learned from my previous months of learning it. I broke down each step to "divide and conquer." 

I first created the JavaScript code by deciding on the algorithm needed for the computer to randomly choose between rock, paper, or scissors. I then created another method for the player to type in something similar. I took care of any situation in which the player may use an invalid option or use different casing for the word (such as PaPEr or PAPER). It will all be recognized the same to the application.

The user will be asked to go for 5 rounds. If after those 5 rounds, the computer has points, then the computer wins. The same is with the player as well. Only in the case that the points are the same, will there be a draw.

A better looking interface will be added shortly to make the project look presentable.
